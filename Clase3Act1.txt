*Creating a pull request
Create a pull request to propose and collaborate on changes to a repository. These changes are proposed in a branch, which ensures that the default branch only contains finished and approved work.

If you want to create a new branch for your pull request and do not have write permissions to the repository, you can fork the repository first.

You can specify which branch you'd like to merge your changes into when you create your pull request. Pull requests can only be opened between two branches that are different.


*Changing the branch range and destination repository
By default, pull requests are based on the parent repository's default branch.

If the default parent repository isn't correct, you can change both the parent repository and the branch with the drop-down lists. You can also swap your head and base branches with the drop-down lists to establish diffs between reference points. References here must be branch names in your GitHub repository.

When thinking about branches, remember that the base branch is where changes should be applied, the head branch contains what you would like to be applied.

When you change the base repository, you also change notifications for the pull request. Everyone that can push to the base repository will receive an email notification and see the new pull request in their dashboard the next time they sign in.

When you change any of the information in the branch range, the Commit and Files changed preview areas will update to show your new range.
